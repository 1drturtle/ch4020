## Review Question

## Periodic Trends

- Everything except ions have a charge of 0.
- \(\ce{NO3-}\): Nitrate
  - -ite means fewer, -ate means more oxygen
  - Most electronegative is Oxygen (Trend goes up and right)
  - Periodic Trends depend on protons.
    - Bonfire analogy (more fire = more protons)
- Atomic radii - Down and left.

## Lewis Structure

- Middle is least electronegative.
- \(\frac{ER - VE}{2}\) = Bonds required
  - ER = Electrons required
  - VE = Valence Electrons
