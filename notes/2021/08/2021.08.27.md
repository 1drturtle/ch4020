Ionization Energy
-----------------

The amount of energy required not knock an electron.

Requires increasing amount of energy for each ionization.

The higher the charge (amount of protons), the more energy required to ionize the atom.

Moles
-----

- 1 mole = Avogadro's number

- Avogadro's number = 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> units of anything

- 12g C<sup>12</sup> = 1 mole

- Use the mole to handle counting atoms since we can't count small amounts of atoms.
