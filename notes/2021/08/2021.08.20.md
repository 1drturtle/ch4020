=====================

**Temperature:** Measure of average kinetic energy

> Never use a number without a unit description!

**Thermometer:** Close tube with something that expands


Fahrenheit was made without thinking of logical values, while Celsius was made to put freezing water at 0 and boiling water at 100.

Celsius = 5/9 * (F - 32)

F = 9/5 * C + 32

pH
--

> pH stands for Power of Hydronium Ions

pH of 7 means 0.0000001 H<sup>+</sup> (1E-6 H<sup>+</sup>)

pH of 6 means 1E-7 H<sup>+</sup>

pH = -log(H<sup>+</sup>)

or, taking the log of the count returns the power.

Why Kelvin
----------


Absolute Zero is -273.15 K, which means all movement stops.

Need to use Kelvin for math, to ensure that we have positive numbers for Math.

Kelvin is referred to as Absolute Temperature (No negatives.)
