## Introduction to Chemical Bonds

- Bond Energy: Energy required to break a bond
- Ionic Bonding: Results from electrostatic attractions of closely packed, oppositely charged ions
- Bond Length: Distance between nuclei of two atoms

## Coulomb's Law

\(E = (2.31 * 10^{-19}\) J*nm \()\) \((\frac{Q_1Q_2}{R})\)
