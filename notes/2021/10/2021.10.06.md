## Introduction to Chemical Bonds

- Bond Energy: Energy required to break a bond
- Ionic Bonding: Results from electrostatic attractions of closely packed, oppositely charged ions
- Bond Length: Distance between nuclei of two atoms
- The more polar a molecule is, the more ionic the bonds are.

## Coulomb's Law

\(E = (2.31 * 10^{-19}\) J*nm \()\) \((\frac{Q_1Q_2}{R})\)

## Hybridization

- Carbon has 2s<sup>2</sup> 2p<sup>2</sup> for 4 valence electrons
- CH<sub>4</sub> has four sigma bonds, one for each hydrogen-carbon bond.
- Electron moves from full 2s<sup>2</sup> to form 2s<sup>1</sup> 2p<sup>3</sup>, making an sp<sup>3</sup> hybrid.
- pi bonds do not count for sp hybridization
