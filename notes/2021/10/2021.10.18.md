# Chem Notes 10/18

- Ionic molecules have __electrostatic__ forces.
- Metals have __low__ electronegativity values.
- Linear molecules __can__ have dipole moments

## Water

- Water pulls ionic compounds apart, allowing them to move around slightly.
- Start with solid, add water, create (aq) ions
- "Like dissolves like" - Similar compounds will dissolve in other similar compounds.

## Solution

- Solute: Gets dissolved
- Solvent: Does the dissolving

## Conductivity

- Pure water does not conduct
- Electrolyte: Produces a solution that can conduct electricity when dissolved in water

### Electrolytes

- Strong Electrolytes: Conduct current very efficiently
  - Ex: NaCl or Strong Acids
- Weak Electrolytes: Conduct a small current
  - Ex: Weak acids
- Bases: Turn water into hydroxide ion, similar to acids for electrolytes.

### Non-electrolytes

- Substances that dissolve in water and do not produce any ions
  - Ex: Ethanol, Sugar

## Molarity

- Commonly used expression for concentration

- \(M = \) molarity = (moles of solute)/(liters of solution).
- Or, Moles of solute = Liters of solution \(\cdot\) molarity.
- Dilution: \(M_1V_1 = M_2V_2\)
  - M1/V1 = Molarity and volume of first substance
  - M2/V2 = molarity and volume of 2nd substance.
