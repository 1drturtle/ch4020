Topic: Ionic & Metallic Bonds

## Intramolecular Forces

- Covalent Bonds: Shared Electrons
- Macromolecular: compounds that are high molecular mass compounds that are covalently bonded and linear, branched, or crosslinked.
  - EX: Plastic/Polymer/Proteins
- Network: Compounds in which each atom is covalently bonded to all its nearest neighbors, so that the entire crystal is one molecule, Very Strong.
  - EX: Diamond/Graphite
- Ionic Bond: A bond which holds atoms together in a compounds by transfers of electrons, forms cation and anion with noble gas configuration
- Metallic Bond: A bond resulting frm the attraction between positive ions and surrounding mobile electrons.

## Intermolecular Forces

- Electrostatic: attractive forces between ions of opposite charge
  - Created by Ionic Bonds.
- Dispersion: attractive forces that arise between temporary dipoles and induced dipoles
- Dipole-Dipole: Forces of attraction between polar molecules.
- Ion-Dipole: forces of attraction between cation/anion and solvent molecules when dissolved in water or other polar molecules.
- Hydrogen bonding: Special type of Dipole-Dipole created by atoms bonding with Hydrogen, much stronger than normal dipole-dipole forces.

### Force Numbers

- H bond: 10-40
- Dipole: 5-25
- Dispersion/London: 0.05 - 40

## Ionic Properties

- Hard (strong electrostatic force)
- Brittle (Repellence between charges)

## Metallic

- Sea of Electrons
- Hard (Strong attractive force)
- Deformable (Electron Sea bonding)
- Electric/Thermal conductivity
- Luster
