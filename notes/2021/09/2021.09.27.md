## Lewis Structures

- Halogens usually not in middle
- Carbon usually in middle.
- Middle atom has lowest electronegativity.
- Hydrogen/Helium need 2, all other atoms need 8

- When you can draw more than one structure, you must draw the resonance structure by drawing both with a double-sided arrow between them.
- Always write Lewis Structures on brackets with ions

## Formal Charge

- valence electrons - (# unshared/non-bonding electrons + 1/2 # shared/bonding electrons)

## Lab Discussion

- what does the lewis structure tell you
- what do you learn from the geometry
- what do you know about hybridization/what is it used for
- polarity of bond/polarity of molecule
  - polar bond: polarity between bonds of different electronegativity atoms
  - molecule polarity: based off geometry.
- bond angles/how to predict bond angles
  - based off # of attachments
  - AXE notation
- bond length
  - more bonds = tighter/closer = more energy
- formal charge
  - used to determine best structure from options
