## Cobalt (Co) Blue Glass

- Cobalt Blue Glass can absorb light in the wave-length of 490-670 nm, especially the yellow color (570 - 590nm)
- In the Flame test, Co blue glass removed the flame colour of sodium to find the other concentration

## Water and Solubility

Water is negatively charged on the side without hydrogen, which (with enough water), pulls the Lithium apart creating Lithium ions and Nitrate cations.

> Cation is + and Anion is - charged.

In a solution, the cations and anions must equal a charge of `0`.

> Incandesent bulb produced all wavelengths of visible light, which was caused by blackbody radiation of an electrified tungsten filament and the coat of the lightbulb smooths the light.
