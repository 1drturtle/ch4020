# Chem Notes 9/08

## Seeing Color

Light causes double bond to flip, rotating the molecule, which stimulates a nerve to fire.

Ganglion cells regulate color signals.

## Notes

- Speed of Light = wave length * frequency
- Microwaves are tuned to the frequency to vibrate water molecules

Wave Info:

- Frequency: cycles per second
- Wavelength: distance wave travels in one cycle.
- Amplitude: Height of wave crest

Wave Notes:

- As the wavelength increases, frequency decreases.
- Angstrom: 10^-10 m
- Frequency = speed of light/wavelength

## Photons

Photons are both waves and particles (have characteristics of both).

## Blackbody Radiation

- Solid object emits visible light when heated to about 1000 K.
- Relates energy to frequency and wavelength.
- E = nhv
  - E = energy
  - n = positive integer
  - h = Planck's constant

## Bohr Model

- Angular momentum = mvr = n(h/2pi)
  - n = number of energy levels
  - h = planck's constant
- E = -B<sub>H</sub>/n<sup>2</sup>
  - B<sub>h</sub> 2.18x10<sup>-18</sup> J/particle
