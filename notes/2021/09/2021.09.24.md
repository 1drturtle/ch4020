# Chem Notes 09/24 - Bonding

## Beginning of Class

- Ionic compounds contain a cation and anion combined, but you won't find a container of Na<sup>+</sup> for example.
- Positively charged ions give their electron(s) to negatively charged elements.
- NaCl dissolves on water, because water molecules "gang up" on the salt molecules, and use their polar charges to pull the molecules apart.
  - "appears to disappear"
  - need to have charge neutrality in dissolved substances.

## Ionic Compounds

- Electron is "more closely" to the Chlorine than to the Sodium.
- Ionic Bonding results from electrostatic forces
- Almost always metal + nonmetal

## Covalent Bonding

- Electrons are shared between the atoms
- Two atoms that are both missing electrons, share one to create a strong bond.
- Forms when two atoms become close enough to share electrons but not close enough where the nucleus would repel each other.
  - When they are too close, bond energy increases exponentially.

## Metallic Bonding

- "sea of electrons"
- The sea of electrons allows electrons to easily be transferred through the metals, making it very conductable.

## Intro to Chemical Bonds

- Bond Energy: Energy required to break a bond.
- Bond Length: distance between two atoms when potential energy is minimal
- Electronegativey can be used to predict ionic/covalent/metallic bonding. (has no unit)

### Coulomb's Law

- Used to calculate the energy of a bond.
