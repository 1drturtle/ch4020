# Class Notes 9/17

Test Topics:

- Measurements
  - Volume: liter or m<sup>3</sup>
    - 1L = 1000 cm<sup>3</sup>
  - Mass: Amount of matter in an object
  - Density: Mass per volume, like g/cm<sup>3</sup>
  - Sig figs: All we know for sure plus one estimate digit
    - Use sig figs from least precise measurement
  - Temperature: Measure of average kinetic energy.
    - Measured by a liquid that expands with heat.

- The Atom
  - Nucleus (Proton, Neutron)
    - Extra neutrons make isotopes of an element, extra protons make new elements.
  - Electrons (Orbits, s orbit, p orbit, d orbit)

- Nomenclature
  - Inorganic compounds
  - Polyatomic compounds
- Atomic mass, isotopes, natural abundance
- Empirical/Molecular formula
  - Percent composition
