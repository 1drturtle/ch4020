## Trial #1

### Moles of NaOH

- \(23 + 16 + 1.01 = 40.01\) g/mol
- \(0.533 M = \frac{x}{41.63 mL}\)
- \(x = (0.533 M) \cdot 0.04163 L\)
- \(x = 0.022 \ce{mol NaOH}\)

### Mass of \(\ce{CH3COOH}\)

- Molar mass = \((12.01 * 2) + (1.01 * 4) + (16 * 2) = 60.06 g/mol\)
- \(\ce{0.022 mol CH3COOH * 60.06 g/mol = 1.32 g CH3COOH}\)

### Mass % of \(\ce{CH3COOH}\)

- \(\ce{1.32 g CH3COOH / 25.048 g vinegar = 0.053 = 5.3\% CH3COOH}\)

### Relative Percent Error

- \(\frac{5.3 - 5}{5} = 0.06 = 6\%\)

### Molarity of \(\ce{CH3COOH}\)

- \(\ce{M = \frac{0.022 mol CH3COOH}{0.025 L Vinegar} = 0.88 M}\)

## Trial #2

### Moles of NaOH

- \(23 + 16 + 1.01 = 40.01\) g/mol
- \(0.533 M = \frac{x}{42.25 mL}\)
- \(x = (0.533 M) \cdot 0.04225 L\)
- \(x = 0.023 \ce{mol NaOH}\)

### Mass of \(\ce{CH3COOH}\)

- Molar mass = \((12.01 * 2) + (1.01 * 4) + (16 * 2) = 60.06 g/mol\)
- \(\ce{0.023 mol CH3COOH * 60.06 g/mol = 1.38 g CH3COOH}\)

### Mass % of \(\ce{CH3COOH}\)

- \(\ce{1.38 g CH3COOH / 25.519 g vinegar = 0.054 = 5.4\% CH3COOH}\)

### Relative Percent Error

- \(\frac{5.4 - 5}{5} = 0.08 = 8\%\)

### Molarity of \(\ce{CH3COOH}\)

- \(\ce{M = \frac{0.023 mol CH3COOH}{0.025 L Vinegar} = 0.92x M}\)

## Averages

### Average Mass %

- \(5.3 + 5.4 / 2 = 5.35 \%\)

### Average Percent Error

- \(\frac{6 + 8}{2} = 7\%\)
