## Part A

- moles of acetic acid = (0.5 M)(0.0395 L) = \(0.01975 mol\)
- g of acetic acid = \(0.01975 * 60.052 = 1.19 g\)
- g of vinegar = 25 ml * 1 g/mol = 25 g
- \(\frac{1.19}{26.19} = 0.045\) = 4.5%

## Part B

- \(\frac{5 - 4.74}{5} = 0.052 = 5.2%\)

## Part c

- Molarity = (moles of solute)/(liters of solution)
- Molarity = (0.01975)/(1.19)
- M =
