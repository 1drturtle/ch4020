Nail & Test Tube Lab
====================

Test Tubes
----------

Order of Chemicals are listed from bottom to top of the test tube.
1. NaCl -> Filter -> CuCl2 -> Filter -> Nail & Water -> Cap
2. CuCl -> Filter -> NaCl -> Nail & Water -> Cap
3. NaCl -> Filter -> CuSO4 -> Filter -> Nail & Water -> Cap
4. CuSO4 -> Filter -> NaCl -> Filter -> Nail & Water -> Cap
5. NaCl -> Filter -> CuCl2 -> Filter -> Nail

Observations
------------

1. Little to no water change above the first filter. Nail has rapidly rusted, and most of the Copper Chloride has dissolved, turning the water below the filter green. NaCl seems to be unaffected other than green due to water. No heat or visible gases emitted.
2. Half of the salt has begun floating in the water, water has not reached through the salt to Copper Chloride. No gas or heat emitted, Nail remains normal in color and size. When water reached the Copper Chloride, it became slightly more green.
3. Nail started to rust/oxidize. Copper Sulfide became slightly bluer, and NaCl became slightly green as water reached through the second filter paper.
4. Copper Sulfide became turquoise. Nail sank through the NaCl and started to rust on contact with Copper Sulfide. No heat or gas.
5. Control Tube. No reaction observed when nail placed in test tube.
