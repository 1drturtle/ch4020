Nail & Test Tube Lab
====================

Test Tubes
----------

Order of Chemicals are listed from bottom to top of the test tube.
1. NaCl -> Filter -> CuCl2 -> Filter -> Nail & Water -> Cap
2. CuCl -> Filter -> NaCl -> Nail & Water -> Cap
3. NaCl -> Filter -> CuSO4 -> Filter -> Nail & Water -> Cap
4. CuSO4 -> Filter -> NaCl -> Filter -> Nail & Water -> Cap
5. NaCl -> Filter -> CuCl2 -> Filter -> Nail

Observations
------------

1. Little to no water change above the first filter. Nail has rapidly rusted, and most of the Copper Chloride has dissolved, turning the water below the filter green. NaCl seems to be unaffected other than green due to water. No heat or visible gases emitted.
2. Half of the salt has begun floating in the water, water has not reached through the salt to Copper Chloride. No gas or heat emitted, Nail remains normal in color and size. When water reached the Copper Chloride, it became slightly more green.
3. Nail started to rust/oxidize. Copper Sulfide became slightly bluer, and NaCl became slightly green as water reached through the second filter paper.
4. Copper Sulfide became turquoise. Nail sank through the NaCl and started to rust on contact with Copper Sulfide. No heat or gas.
5. Control Tube. No reaction observed when nail placed in test tube.

Observations - Day 2
--------------------
1. Nail has orange growths emerging from it. NaCl has slight pink growth on one side. CuCl<sub>2</sub> has switched positions on the test tube as the NaCl floated above it. Water is slightly tinted brown.
2. Nail has rusted more, small orange particles floating freely in water. 
3. NaCl has become brown, but slightly green near the top. Nail has rusted more with orange particles sitting on top of the CuSO<sub>4</sub>
4. In between CuSO<sub>4</sub> and NaCl, nail has pink growths on it, that seem to look like a crystal. Water has turned slightly yellow near NaCl. Nail has continued to rust.
5. Nail has rusted, salt and CuCl<sub>2</sub> has turned slightly yellow near contact with nail.

Comparisons - Day 2
-------------------
Tube 1 had a much more severe reaction, even producing the pink crystal-like substance that was found in Tube 4. Tube 2 has much less particles and more salts remaining than tube 1.

In Tube 4, much less CuCl<sub>2</sub> remains than in Tube 3. Tube 4 had a much more severe reaction, but the NaCl in Tube 3 turned brown while the remaining NaCl in Tube 4 turned black.


Observations - Day 5
--------------------

1. Filters have been more transparent. Water is more yellow and orange substance has fallen off nail and sank to the bottom on top of the salt. Slightly more pink compounds have formed inside the salt (NaCl). Nail has become much more thin
2. More NaCl has turned green and nail has become slightly thinner.
3. Pink compounds have grown out like roots and are holding the nail in the water. Salt has turned almost completely dark green. Water is yellow at the top and nail is thinner.
4. Nail has collapsed, part of it is in the salt, and two other pieces are floating on top of the salt (NaCl). Turquoise substance has formed in the bottom of the test tube.
5. Nail has slightly rusted more but other than that little to no change.

Comparisons - Day 5
-------------------

Nails is tubes 1-4 have become thinner, likely due to the rusting of the nail.
