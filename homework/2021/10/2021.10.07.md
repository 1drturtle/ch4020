## Ch 10

### 10.9

- Evaporation: When a substance changes from a liquid to a gas.
- Condensation: When a substance changes from a gas to a liquid.
- Sublimation: When a substance change directly from a solid to a gas.
- Boiling: The act of heating a liquid past so it evaporates.
- Melting: Heating a solid enough that it becomes a liquid.
- Enthalpy of Vaporization: Amount of energy that needs to be added to a substance for it to evaporate.
- Enthalpy of fusion: The amount of energy needed to change a solid to a liquid.
- Heating Curve: Graph showing the amount of energy needed for each of an element's phase changes.

### 10.38

- BaSO4: Ionic bond between Ba and SO4 creates Dipole.
- H2S: Dipole forces
- Xe: Instantaneous dipole-induced forces
- C2H6: Instantaneous dipole-induced forces
- CsI: Ionic bond between Cs and I creates Dipole.
- P4: Dipole forces (unshared on center)
- NH3: Dipole forces (unshared on center)

### 10.43

- HBr: Has polarity, and LD forces
- NaCl: Ionic bond wins out
- I2: LD forces because it's bigger
- N2: nonpolar, smallest so small LD
- CH4: same as above
- HF: Hydrogen bond
