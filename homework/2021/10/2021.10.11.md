## Chapter 10

### AP #1

- HI due to dispersion and HF due to hydrogen bond, so C

### AP #3

- C

### AP #4

- A

### 10.114

- The first compound has a dipole moment and a hydrogen bond, which gives it the boiling point.
- The second compound also has a dipole moment and a hydrogen bond, but it has a higher molar mass giving it a greater boiling point.
- The third compound has a dipole moment, but since it has no hydrogen bond it has a much lower boiling point.

### AP #8

- D

### AP #9

- A

### AP #14

- A

### 10.45

- With water, the molecules are polar, which gives it strong cohesion & adhesion. This adhesion causes the water to stick to the side of the glass and form the meniscus. Mercury is not polar, so it has low adhesion and greater cohesion, which causes it to stick to itself instead of the glass

## Chapter 11

### 11.53

- A) NH3
- B) CH3CN
- C) CH3CO-OH

### AP 14

- C, the two dots are furthest apart.
