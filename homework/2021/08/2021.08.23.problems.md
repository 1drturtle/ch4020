- 1.47:
    - a: 1.25 miles * 8 miles/furlong = 10 furlongs
    - b: 10 furlongs * 40 rods/furlong = 400 rods
    - c: 400 rods * 5.5 yds/rod = 2,200 yds
- 1.51: 15.6 g of capsules / 0.65 g/capsule = 24 capsules
- 1.55: 
    - m/h -> m/s: 65 mph / (3600 seconds/hour) = 0.0180 miles/second
    - 0.0180 miles/second * 5280 feet/mile = **95.04 feet** 
- 1.67: 
    - a. C = 2.8X - 10
    - b. X = (C + 10)/2.8, X = (22 + 10)/2.8, X = 14.43
    - c.
        X: 58.0 X
        C: 24.286 C
        F: 24.286 * (9/5) + 32 = 75.715 F
        K: 24.286 + 273.15 = 297.436 K
- 1.127:
