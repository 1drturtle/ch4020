## Chapter 7

### q119

Se has a lower ionization energy than expected due to having the two electrons in the same orbit. This creates more repulsion and allows one of the electrons to be easier removed.

### q120

The order would be B, Be, C, N, O.

Be is after B because the electrons are closer to the nucleus (no `p` orbital) and are harder to remove. Otherwise, it follows the periodic trend of higher ionization energy to the right.

### q 159

Alkaline-Earth, because of 2 valence electrons.

### q 169

- Element A: Te (Tellurium)
- Element B: Ge (Germanium)
- Element C: F (Flourine), last electron jumped an energy level.
